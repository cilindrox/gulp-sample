gulp-sample
===========

A gulp project sample for an SO question - http://stackoverflow.com/q/23506545/992453

## Requisites

This needs node, npm and gulp to be installed on your machine. Particularly, [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) needs to be globally available (so you can call it from the command line). All you need to do is:

```
npm install -g gulp   
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repo && `cd` into it
2. Run `npm install` and let npm work its magic
3. Run `gulp`
4. ????
5. Change any file under `./assets/js` and it'll trigger both `nodemon` and the `watch` task(s).
